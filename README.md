# Gratitude Survey

The user can use this survey over and over again to critically think about the things they are grateful for.

## Improvements

I'd like to make a collection of products based on the users input. Basically I'd like to make a collection of art that is based on the elements and the things the person generates. For example, if the user like fire and art, they get an artistic image of fire with the name of the person they love and the things they are interested in written over the top of it.

## Thank You

Big thanks to Free Code Camp. This is the best way I have found to learn to program.
